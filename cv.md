## Summary:      
   Iâ€™m going to start working as a Junior Front-End Developer in IT product this year.My main goal is to become a highly qualified full-stack developer. I also want to improve my soft skills to work in a team and in the future become a leader, teach and improve my knowledge constantly. About myself, I am goal-oriented, stubborn but not so much as not to accept criticism, friendly, and have little experience working in a team(not related to development).
